# How to log in to the cluster, type:
$ ssh abdull01@clust1-headnode.cri.camres.org 
$ cd /scratchb/sblab/
$ ls <list directory/folders in the sblab>
$ mkdir abdull01 <make new directory/folder for me>
$ cd abdull01 <enter my directory>
$ ls <list in my directory>
$ mkdir 180508_iCLIP1_DDX17 <make new directory for each new project>

# How to retrieve your sequencing data:
Open a new terminal, to to the 'staging server' where also sequencing data that has been demultiplex by Genomics are kept:
$ ssh sblab-srv001
$ ls /media/staging/ <lots of files will come up. Need to know DATE when you SEQUENCE>
$ ls /media/staging/180301_*/ <wildcard: find any files in the directory that starts with 180301_ ,and ends with anything hence the star.>
$ ls /media/staging/180301_*/fastq <sequencing data will be in fastq directory, so add fastq to the command. Looking for folder that starts with 180301, and for any of these folders, look for fastq folder>
