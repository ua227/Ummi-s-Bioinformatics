# Go to COMPUTER TERMINAL (not cluster!)
$ scp CLUSTER(SOURCE) COMPUTER_TERMINAL(LOCATION)
# scp abdull01@clust1-headnode.cri.camres.org:/scratchb/sblab/abdull01/180823_iCLIP2_DDX17/*.bedgraph /Users/abdull01/Desktop/
*In example above, I copied all files ending with .bedgraph from the cluster to my desktop 

How to copy files/folders from cluster to cluster:
